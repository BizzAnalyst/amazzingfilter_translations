**Providing missing translations for the popular Prestashop module 'Amazzing Filter'.**

This repository contains AI-generated translation packs for the Prestashop module Amazzing Filter v. 3.3.0, "a powerful layered navigation module"). The original module package lacks comprehensive translations for various languages, which can be a barrier for merchants using Prestashop in different regions.

**Motivation:**

The goal of this project is to bridge the translation gap for 'Amazzing Filter', making it more accessible to a wider audience. By leveraging AI translation tools, we've created initial translation sets to improve the out-of-the-box experience for international users.

**About Amazzing Filter:**

Amazzing Filter is a highly customizable and feature-rich layered navigation module for Prestashop. It allows customers to easily filter products based on various attributes, improving the shopping experience and increasing conversion rates.

**Translation Approach:**

The translations in this repository were generated using AI translation models. While these translations offer a good starting point, they may not be perfect and could benefit from human review and refinement.
